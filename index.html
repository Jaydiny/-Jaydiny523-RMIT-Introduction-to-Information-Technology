         <h3>Personal Information</h3>   
            <p>My name is Jack Yumulu - Student Number: s3832082 - Email Address: s3832082@student.rmit.edu.au. <br> <br> I was born in Australia with a Turkish and Spanish background. I can speak Spanish but not Turkish. I finished VCE in 2012 and my two favourite subjects were IT and Multimedia Design. I then completed 1 year in TAFE, and studied CERT IV Information Technology, which I found interesting. I have been working in IT for over 6 years, my first job being a Customer Support Technician at the Austin Hospital (which was extremely depressing). I worked there for 3 months and then landed a job at ARN where I currently work, being a Radio Station that manages KIIS 101.1 and GOLD 104.3. My current role is a hybrid between IT jobs and broadcasting jobs, ranging from fixing users MS Outlook issue to troubleshooting broadcasting audio on issues. I find this position to be very enjoyable because I like the challenge of investigating various problems from one day to the next. </p>
             
            <p>In my spare time, I like to play video games, watch anime or just chill out with friends. I also have a dog named Nero who is a grumpy old Cavoodle now as he is turning 11 soon. </p>
