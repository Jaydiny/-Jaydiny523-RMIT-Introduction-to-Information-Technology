        <h1>Runeterra Informative / Guide Website</h1>
         <h3>Project Idea</h3> 
         <h3>Overview</h3>  
            <p>The following report will be about a project idea about creating a website based around the game called Runeterra which is created by Riot. This is a strategy card game and when I played it felt as if there weren’t any content online to guide the players on how to play and strategies to win.  </p>
            <p>The website will have three main sections:</p>  
            <ul>
                <li>How-to Play Basics</li>
                <li>Strategies </li>
                <li>Top Tier Decks</li>
            </ul>
          <p>I will also try to implement a news section which will pull its data straight from the official website, which will show upcoming updates and news that the community will be interested in.</p>
        <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p>This project will be a great vessel for all types of players who are just looking to improve their skillset or find a different play style to change things up. It will be interesting and beneficial for those who use it, allowing them to have an advantage over their competitors by using the strategies and guides provided on the website.  Building this website will also help me learn the tools I require to apply or compete for my ideal job for a Front-End Web Developer.</p>
        <h3>Features of the Service</h3>
        <p>The website will be broken in three sections as mentioned in the overview.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>How-to Play Basics:</b> The How-To Play basics of the website will inform the users about the basics of the game, such as describing basic concepts, how cards interact with each other and the best ways to visualise/strategise each scenario based on the cards you have been given. </li>
            <li><b>Strategies:</b> This will be detailed descriptions about different strategies the players can try based off the decks they are using, and how each card can affect play.</li>
            <li><b>Top Tier Decks:</b> This section will be describing the best decks currently in season that are winning consistently and played by top ranking players. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>I will also integrate user friendly navigation; this will allow the users who use the site to easily navigate around the page and keep them coming back. The less they need to think about whilst using the site the better.</p>

    <h3>Tools and Technologies / Skills Required</h3>
    <p>The software required to get this project up and running are as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Domain Name:</b> Using such providers as GoDaddy or Domain.com, this service should only set you back $20 a year depending on the name unless it’s a premium name then they can go up to hundreds or thousands of dollars</li>
        <li><b>Text Editor:</b>Sublime Text / Notepad++ / Visual Studio Code – This is what will be required to build up the website’s pages, using HTML, CSS and JavaScript maybe jQuery if need be</li>
        <li><b>Web Browsers:</b>To check the work prior to building the website such as Chrome, Firefox or IE, also allowing you to access developer tools</li>
        <li><b>Version Control Tools:</b>Github – This will make sure you have versioning control and can rollback or upgrade when need be</li>
        <li><b>Visual Server:</b> A host website or service such as Amazon AWS or Google Cloud Platform</li>
        <li><b>Image Manipulation Software:</b> Adobe Photoshop – This will help editing images to make it perfect for what is intended for the site and adjust aspect ratios</li>
        <li><b>Bootstrap:</b>This tool is very handy if you want to use this to form a template using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create the base of your website </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using the tools above I will be able to create the website required for the project to the best of my ability.</p>
    <p>The skills are easily obtainable simply by putting in the time to learn the programs/software above as they are mostly all open source. The trickiest part would be to sync up all the data across multiple platforms, to make it as widely accessible as possible, providing access on any given device.</p>

    <h3>Outcome</h3>
    <p>If this project is created and is successful, this will impact thousands if not millions of the player-base to be able to research new in-game strategies and guides. Having this website will also keep the player-base consistently interested in the game by creating new strategies for them to try and accomplish. New players will also find it informative as this is mostly targeted towards the new player-base. This will be a one stop shop (website) for all players to go to for anything related to Runeterra as the news section of the website will be directly linked to the official website.</p>
