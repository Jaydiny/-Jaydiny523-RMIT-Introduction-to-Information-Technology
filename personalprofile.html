       <h3>Personal Profile</h3>
       <h3>Test 1: Myers-Briggs Test Results:</h3>   
       <img class="mediator" src="images\Mediator.png" alt="Mediator">
           <p>After completing the Myers-Brigg test being defined as a Mediator shows that I am always trying to be positive about any situation and always trying to find the best possible solution to the problems I may face. These results will influence the behaviour of being in a team as I am not assertive with my actions and tend to be quiet when voicing my opinion. As a Mediator it would be best for me, to include people of complete opposite nature to get a broad way of thinking, people who are very self-confident and observant as to compared to my turbulent and intuitive nature. </p> 

       <h3>Test 2: Online Learning Style Test</h3>
       <img class="learning" src="images\Learning Style Test.png" alt="Learning">
        <p>For the Learning Style test, I have been perceived as 39% Auditory Learner which has the following characteristic traits:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You benefit from reading aloud, and you learn best through listening</li>
            <li>Easy to memorize what you hear</li>
            <li>You like to listen to lectures, music, and others talking</li>
            <li>You like talking to yourself</li>
            <li>You are a good storyteller</li>
            <li>You like talking more than writing</li>
            <li>You may have problems with projects involving visualization</li>
            <li>You get distracted by outside noise (two people talking at once)</li>
            <li>Prefer listening to the news instead of reading it</li>
            <li>You remember names easily</li>
            <li>Don’t automatically understand graphs, diagrams, and maps</li>
            <li>Love music</li>
            <li>Like to tell jokes and stories</li>
            <li>You are often an articulate speaker</li>
            <li>Will follow spoken directions well</li>   
            <li>Repeat phone numbers aloud to remember them</li>
            <li>Love it when you can speak up. You don’t enjoy keeping quiet for very long</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Considering Auditory Learner was the highest percentage out of the other two learning styles it has stuck out to me and I have researched insights for Auditory Learner.</p>
        <p>It was also stated that people with this type of learning style may find it easier to learn by listening to music with no words such as Mozart, which I found interesting as I am always listening to music, regardless of what I am doing. </p>
        <p>These results will influence my behaviour in a team due to working with different individuals and the way they process information and the way they learn. If the team decides to try to use mind maps for planning activities, I may find it hard to collaborate with them as I am not much of a visual person. </p>
        <p>When forming a team, I should try and find other Auditory Leaners to best handle group information and projects so that we can work collectively together. </p>

        <h3>Test 3: Visionary-Pragmatist Quiz</h3>
        
        <p><q>“The Visionary-Pragmatist quiz is about the Vision-Pragmatism personality trait. This trait greatly influences people’s preferences in terms of lifestyle and business activity. This quiz will help you understand the extent of forward-thinking and focus on the future that is right for you.” -<a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/visionary-pragmatist" >http://www.humanmetrics.com/visionary-pragmatist</a> </q></p>
        <p>I decided to partake in the Visionary- Pragmatist Quiz for my third test, the results are below:</p>
        <img class="learning" src="images\Vision.png" alt="Learning">
        <p>The results of the Visionary-Pragmatist quiz display that I work well with facts and try to find solutions with what I know using my past experiences. I am open minded to find new methods to accomplish tasks. With this mindset it will help me development the technical aspects within the team to implement new initiatives and ideas. I will be able to use the facts the team has gathered to build a strategy to complete the task at hand, however I will also be open to other ideas. When forming a team, it is good to get team members of different attributes to obtain a different variety of ideas without straying too far from the goal.</p>
