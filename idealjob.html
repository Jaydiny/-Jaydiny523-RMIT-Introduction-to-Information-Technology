         <h3>Ideal Job</h3>   
            <p>The ideal position I found for myself now would be the below: </p>
            <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?currentJobId=1780527313&keywords=front%20end%20developer">Web Developer - Junior</a> </p>
            <img class="relaxr" src="images\Web Developer - Junior.png" alt="LinkedIn Application"> 
            <p>The ideal job for myself would be something based around building different kinds of websites and the experience from collaborating with a team to build something exciting. This position is appealing to me because I will be able to work from home or have set hours at work. My current position is on a rotating roster, this changes weekly ranging from 4am to 10am starts. I also deal with being On-Call outside of work hours and weekends. Having set hours for work would be beneficial for my sanity and I will be able to plan out my week better without random changes.</p>  
            <p>The skills required for this job is holding experience with the following coding practices: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and jQuery which is a form of JavaScript. Considering it is a junior role, they do not require a broad skill set. They require 2 years working in the same field which I regrettably do not have, though considering it is a Junior Entry level job I donâ€™t see why they cannot make an exception, if you have the skills required.</p>
            <p>I have studied the above skills required for the job in the past with a 3-month short Front-End Web Dev course, but sadly did not continue to learn the skills to retain the information. To be able to be a successful applicant, I would need to brush up on my web development skills. Enrolling myself into a Bachelor of Information Technology will hopefully help me retain and learn new skills to be able to apply for a dream job of my choosing at the time.</p>
