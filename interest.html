         <h3>Interest in IT</h3>   
            <p>My interest in IT began when I was very young when I was introduced to Wolfenstein 3D on our first windows 98 PC. I was captured by the technology and always found myself gravitating towards IT products. I always enjoyed trying to figure out how any technical gadgets in the house worked.</p>
            <p>I really like the programming side of IT, building a front-end or back-end program with code and seeing it all come to life.</p>
            <p>I first started my IT experience at home at a young age, as my Dad is in the industry and he taught me many things, regarding basic troubleshooting or building a personal computer from scratch. From there I picked up multiple IT related subjects in school and completed my Cert I – III in Information Technology and Multimedia. This led me to take it further and I completed a year in TAFE with a CERT IV. </p>
            <p<>Whilst working as a Support Technician I found what the programmers did was interesting and took it upon myself to learn HTML, CSS and jQuery, and even developed a snakes and ladders game. (Sadly, I didn’t retain much.) <a href="https://pages.git.generalassemb.ly/Jaydiny/Final-Project/">Snakes and Ladders</a> </p>
            <p>I chose to learn at RMIT because the course outline for the Information Technology of Bachelors really fits well with my learning interests. I expect to learn the fundamentals of different aspects of IT with this degree such as Networking, programming, usability and the works and hopefully specialise in a certain field that really takes my interest.</p>
